The industry standard:
    A hybrid mode that mixes Asymmetric encryption with Symmetric encryption. 
    The session is opened with RSA to start with the highest security.
    A symmetric key is then exchanged with RSA, to improve speed and data length per encryption.
    This new key is now used in data exchange.

    Even newer stanard:
        The symmetric key is then used to generate a new symmetric key every 30 seconds.
        This creates a 30 second session per key, any intruder will only maintain a session for 30 seconds, before becoming invalidated.
